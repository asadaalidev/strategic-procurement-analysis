# Strategic Procurement Analysis & Insights

An end-to-end **Procurement Analytics** project built in **Power BI + SQL**, focused on spend optimization, supplier reliability, and compliance.  
This project analyzes **777 purchase orders (Jan 2022–Mar 2023)** across **5 categories** and **30 suppliers**, uncovering cost savings, value leakage, and key improvement opportunities.

##  Key Metrics
| Metric                      | Value           |                Insight                   |
|-----------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Realized Spend**          | $35.6M          | Total effective spend after negotiations |
| **Savings**                 | $3.93M (7.97%)  | Negotiations delivered ~8% savings       |
| **Maverick Spend**          | 14.7%           | Off-contract spend causing leakage       |
| **OTD (On-Time Delivery)**  | 68.75%          | Only two-thirds of orders arrive on time |
| **OTIF (On-Time In-Full)**  | 0.54%           | Serious delivery reliability concern     |
| **Avg Lead Time**           | 10 Days         | Moderate procurement cycle time          |
| **Non-Compliance Spend**    | $5.23M          | Significant leakage and policy gaps      |

##  Key Insights
- Procurement achieved **~8% savings**, but nearly **30% of gains were lost** due to quality and compliance gaps.  
- **14.7% maverick spend (~$5.2M)** undermines negotiation power and increases cost leakage.  
- **OTIF (0.54%)** indicates severe reliability risk — suppliers often fail to deliver in full or on time.  
- **Delta_Logistics** underperforms in reliability and compliance, while **Gamma_Co** and **Epsilon_Group** consistently outperform.  
- Categories like **MRO** and **Packaging** need tighter control due to higher off-contract activity.

---

##  Strategic Recommendations
1. **Enforce contract compliance** – Guided buying and stronger procurement governance.  
2. **Improve supplier reliability** – Introduce performance-based SLAs and penalty clauses.  
3. **Tier suppliers** – Prioritize high performers (Gamma_Co, Epsilon_Group), and remediate low performers.  
4. **Focus negotiations** on weaker categories (Office Supplies, Raw Materials) to unlock an extra 2–3% savings.  
5. **Integrate continuous monitoring** via Power BI dashboards for real-time decision-making.
